**What's new on 'Hacker News'?**

Hey There!

> This project extracts news from https://news.ycombinator.com/newest

> It cleans a little bit of the results obtained, like dates and URLs

> It classifies the "news" based on some keywords

> It shows you the result on this Google Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v6jPy3qsobEraNWQ5j9QxkpWjxM6v8Xv8iz5EC-kPMI/edit#gid=0

> It generates a CSV file with the data extracted when you run it locally **

> It could be scheduled to run with GitHub actions every certain time

*Is that not enough?*

Also, it offers a Jupyter Notebook file, which generates graphs where you can check the trendy categories, as simple as it sounds. Less is more.

Potentials are around the way. 
Every feedback or question is welcome :) 


*Note: To run it locally, you can use your own Google Spreadsheet API credential (the key.json file)* **

**Improvements**✒️
The categories can be redefined and played with ML to be more accurate.
