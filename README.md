*What's new on 'Hacker News'?*

Hey There!

> This project extracts news from https://news.ycombinator.com/newest

> Clean a little bit the result obtained, like dates and URLs

> Classify the "news" based on some keywords

> It shows you the result on this Google Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v6jPy3qsobEraNWQ5j9QxkpWjxM6v8Xv8iz5EC-kPMI/edit#gid=0

> It generates a CSV file with the data extracted

> It's scheduled to run every 8 hours

*Is that not enough?*

Also, it offers a Jupyter Notebook file where you can check the trendy categories, as simple as it sounds. Less is more.

Potentials are around the way. Every feedback or question is welcome :)
